        "question": "Is it okay to take pictures with our phones and cameras during the wedding?",
        "answer": "Phones and cameras away during the ceremony please (during the reception is totally fine).

Our amazing photographer will capture all the magic - trust us, they're way better at this than any of us."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is it okay to post photos on social media?",
        "answer": "Emma has claimed first posting rights (totally fair, right?), so please wait until we've sat down for the reception to start sharing. Then it's open season, don't forget to tag us both and show the world what an epic party they're missing out on!"
    },
    {
        "question": "What will the weather be this time of year?",

    {
        "question": "My question isn't here, now what?",
        "answer": "Give us a shout! We're always available for a chat and would rather sort out any questions now than have you confused on the day. Plus if it comes up more than once, we can update this page for others."
